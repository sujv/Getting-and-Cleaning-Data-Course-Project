# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:

  *  Download the zip file from here
   * Unzip the file to the same directory, so we can get :
        features.txt
        subject_train.txt
        X_train.txt
        y_train.txt
        subject_test.txt
        X_test.txt
        y_test.txt
   * After those steps complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R) The output of the R script is a tidy dataset, tidy.txt
